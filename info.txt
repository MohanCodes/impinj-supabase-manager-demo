Literally anyone should be able to set this up.

Sets up the com.examples java files, just make your own package and call it what you want
https://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi only dragged commons-logging, httpclient, and httpcore for supabase into lib
Used HttpClient 4.5.14 because sticking with the oldest version seems to always work
Make sure to build path for all libraries you plan to use, or else you get the red underline of death.
Had to use another HttpClient library because the native Http was released in Java 11
Using the IPJ-REV-R220
Noting the last three couplets (15-25-B4) in the MAC address sticker on the side of the IMPINJ
Connected power through DC 24V
Connected IMPINJ ethernet port to computer ethernet port
http://speedwayR-15-25-B4/ for web information (root/impinj) (last three couplets noted above)
Used Octane SDK Java 3.0.0 because the IMPINJ software is 6.4.1.240
Used really old Java SE-1.8 for the whole Java project because the IMPINJ software is 6.4.1.240
Take a look at my src/log4j.properties, it may or may not be a little different than the one IMPINJ docs uses
Made config.properties with my Supabase URL and KEY

CREATE TABLE public.test (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
  test TEXT -- This is the column we will update
);

-- Optional: Insert a row to test with
INSERT INTO public.test (test) VALUES ('Hello World');

above is the SQL snippet used for the database structure
